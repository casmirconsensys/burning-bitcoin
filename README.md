# burning-bitcoin
oh yeah

Using Cosmos SDK, <strike>IBC</strike>, Agoric, bitcoin-spv/go, <strike>Coda</strike>

- Burn bitcoin
- Send proof of burn to Chain 1 (Cosmos SDK Zone) -> replaced with lotion.js
- Chain 1 checks the proof
- Chain 1 sends message to Chain 2 (Agoric) -> could not run so we are minting tokens with ERTP
- Chain 2 mints burn bitcoin token

- All the gifs
- Coda query data as background -> did not complete
